# My first day of using Symfony2

- Downloaded Symfony
- Created a git repository and cloned it locally (empty repo)
- Commit the repo with a "mydoc" folder containing only this readme file for now

## Commit to git

	git add *
	git commit -m "add a first file describing what I did so far"
	git push origin master
