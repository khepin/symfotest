# My first day of using Symfony2

- Downloaded Symfony
- Created a git repository and cloned it locally (empty repo)
- Commit the repo with a "mydoc" folder containing only this readme file for now

## Commit to git

	git add *
	git commit -m "add a first file describing what I did so far"
	git push origin master

## Add symfony2 files from the downloaded archive

Then commit everything again and push so that our remote repository contains everything needed to work.


Note: Symfony files could be added as a git submodule too instead of downloading everything.
